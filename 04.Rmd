# Topic Modeling

In this final chapter, we move beyond word counts to uncover the underlying topics in a collection of documents. We will be using a standard topic model known as latent Dirichlet allocation.

## Latent Dirichlet allocation



## Topics as word probabilities


## Summarizing topics


## Visualizing topics


## Document term matrices


## Creating a DTM


## Evaluating a DTM as a matrix


## Running topic models


## Fitting an LDA


## Tidying LDA output


## Comparing LDA output


## Interpreting topics


## Naming three topics


## Naming four topics


## Wrap-up
