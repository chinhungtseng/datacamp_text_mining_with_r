# Senetiment Analysis

While word counts and visualizations suggest something about the content, we can do more. In this chapter, we move beyond word counts alone to analyze the sentiment or emotional valence of text.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)

review_data <- read_csv("data/Roomba Reviews.csv")
twitter_data <- readRDS("data/ch_1_twitter_data.rds")
```
